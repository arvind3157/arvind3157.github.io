title: The beginning !

<div style="text-align: justify">
The beginning of anything is hard. Running is not hard,getting up in the morning and putting your first foot outside the door is hard. I failed at it many times and I'm not afraid to start again. I failed at keeping my commitment of writing for a year. I'm going to commit to it again. This time with more energy and learning. I hope to continue my momentum.
