Looking back.  

This picture was taken during 2nd marathon. Total 4 years of running and I’m still a beginner. I still loose my sleep before race day. I still get same excitement and amount of adrenaline rush at start line. I still suck after 32kms and crawl till finish line. I still get side stitches when running a full marathon. But but, nothing is going to stop me from being a better runner. I will continue to evolve as a runner, as a person. One day I will cross 32 kms with smiling face and humbly I will say, ’32 km’, fuck you. I’m stronger. I don’t suck any more. I’m going to kill remaining 10 kms with same smiling face. I’m sure even after loosing, you will be proud of me. Because that’s what you wanted, a better version of me perhaps. Our talks will continue, so my running.
