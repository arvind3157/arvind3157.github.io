### Programming

This article is titled as **Programming Fundamentals**.
Let's start with very fundamental question **_What is Programming?_**
One more thing, before we start talking about it, when we use the term programming, we are talking about Computer Programming.
Let's see what Wikipedia says about Computer Programming

> Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task.

That looks good but I'm not sure if it's that easy for beginners.
In attempt to simplify further, programming can be thought of a mathematical function. It accepts some input, does some processing and returns output.
What goes inside the function is the core goal of this series of tutorial to uncover.

I have divided this into series of topics. We will go through it one by one.
To convey the thought we need to choose one programming language.
Do read <u>Why do we need programming Language?</u>
For this tutorial, I have chosen Javascript as our programming language.

1. [Javascript - Data Types](/Javascript-DataTypes/)
2. [Javascript - Variables](/Javascript-Variables/)
3. [Javascript - Arrays](/Javascript-Arrays/)

### Beginning
Today, I ran again after long time. It's not that I am new to the running but I took a gap for few months for some personal reason. In the past 5 years, I have had run 22 official marathons, that includes 14 half marathons, 5 full marathons and 2 ultra marathons. I was not as comfortable as I was when I used to train regularly. Anyway, that was just about me. Nothing about programming.
